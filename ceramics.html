<p>Here is a piggy bank I made of baby shoes with high fire glaze. I like my work to look apocolyptic so that is why they are not baby colors.</p></center>
<center><img src="plugs/flask.jpg">
<p>This is a flask that I made which is actually two feet wide. I wanted it to look like mold was growing on it. This is before I glazed and fired it because the glaze reacted wrong and I need to redo it.</p></center>
