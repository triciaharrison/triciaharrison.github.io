<h1>"Current"</h1>
<center><img src="img/9.jpg">
<p>Obviously this is not a current photo of Taylor and I, we are about eleven in this photo. I describe "current" as around eleven to now. This was taken while camping. In this photo you can see the scar tissue in my cheek pretty well. That scar tissue is actually from Taylor pushing me off her bed and into my bed frame. Thats why not my smile is a little crooked, but not nearly as bas as it used to be. It used to be worse than as seen in this photo because it happened when we were eight.</p></center>

<p>This is our prom photo from Junior year of high school, so we were about sixteen. It was actually really sweet because I had just broken up with my boyfriend and had no one to go with, so Taylor asked me to prom with a promposal and everything. Yes, this photo was taken in our grandparents vineyard. For me, this photo represents how strong our bond still is, and shows how much love we have for one another. </p></center>

<p>This photo we are eighteen and it was our solo trip to Disneyland. Taylor had never been before (I had gone a few times for music competitions with our high shcool). This trip was so much fun, and it was a good experience to do a little roadtrip and stay in a hotel on our own. We are from northern California so the trip is even longer than it is from here. We also had never stayed in a hotel with our family, so this was Taylor's first time in a hotel as well.</p></center>
