<h1>The Middle</h1>

<p>In this photo we are probably around two or three. My dad was playing with us in our living room. We grew up in the country so we were always outdoors and have the scars to prove it. Our grandparents own a vineyard and we would run around barefoot on the gravel and down in the creek. Whenever it rained we would put on shorts and t-shirts and have a contest of who could get the most covered in mud, which our mom thoroughly enjoyed.</p></Center>

<p>In this photo we are around five. We are sitting on a tractor wheel next to my papas old truck. When Taylor and I started school, they decided to put us into seperate classrooms which was very difficult for us to deal with. Not only were we dealing with the stressors of starting school, we were also having to do it alone when we were used to being together. Their reasoning is because we were very dependent on one another and they wanted us to be independent. Taylor was very shy so she would talk to me and I would say it to the actual person. We would sit in class waiting for lunch and break so we could reunite.</p></center>

<p>We are about six in this photo. This was taken at my dads moms house. I love this photo because Taylor (who is on the right) looks super creepy. As kids, Taylor and I always got into all kinds of trouble. I remember one time at my grandmas house, we decided to take a ride on one of those short carts you use to inspect under a car. We rode it down my grandmas steep graval driveway. Needless to say, we ended up with some roadrash because it did not pan out as we planned.</p></center>

<p>In this photo we are around eight. I think this is one of the photos we look most identical because we are both smiling the same and very eeriely have our heads tilted the same. And in case you couldn't tell, we did in fact make those shirts ourselves with spray paint. (Yes they were pretty stiff).</p></center>
