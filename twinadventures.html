<h1>The Beginning</h1>
<center><img src="img/momprego.jpg">
<p>This is my mom and older sister Samantha. My moms water had broken and she realized they never took this photo so they did before leaving for the hospital. Thats why her smile is a little forced. When my parents first found out that they were having twins, they were suprisingly very excited. My mom saw it as the universe making both of their wishes come true, because my dad wanted four kids, but my mom only wanted to be pregnant three times. So they ended up with my sister Taylor and I. </p></center>

<p>Here is one of the earlier photos of Taylor and I. We were weirdly born with super dark hair. The first few months were definately an adjustment period. Taking care of one newborn is difficult enough, and having two is quite the challenge. Two babies that need to be fed, changed, and soothed. It also did not really help that when one of us would start crying, the other would follow suit. </p></center>

<p>This is from one of our first photoshoots. My dad worked in construction and thought it would be adorable if we posed as little painters. Taylor learned to crawl first but I learned to walk first. I would utilize this walking advantage to take things from Taylor and walk away and she tried to crawl after me. I would also later on climb out of my crib and into Taylor's.</p></center>

<p> In this photo we are about four years old, and I have no idea where this was taken. Growing up with a twin automatically enstills the code of sharing and compromise very early on. We had to share almost everything, and we became very good at splitting food and drinks exactly even. With a twin, you also never have the issue of having no one to play with. We were contantly with one another and never needed to try to get someone to play with us, because we had eachother.</p></center>
